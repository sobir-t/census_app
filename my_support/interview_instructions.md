Here are instructions on interview preparations. If you haven't deployed application locally then please follow instructions [here](my_support/local_deployment_instructions.md). You are expected to be on interview with

- locally running census app and postgres database
- Automation framework with test scenarios
- DBeaver connected to postgres database
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) with collection having API requests to census app.

## 1 UI test preconditions

[Content](#content)

1. As you have application up and running please open url `localhost:3000/` on your preferred browser and manually register your first user and login.
2. Add household. Please don't use any real addresses.
3. Add record with relationship = `SELF`. Please don't use any PII (Personal Identifiable Information). When creating dummy data for personal demographic information QA best practice is to add `FAKE` word to beginning of names.

## 2 Framework setup

[Content](#content)

Please have your test automation framework setup using next software:

- IntelliJ IDE
- Java
- Maven
- Cucumber or JUnit or TestNG
- Selenium
- Rest assured
- JDBC
- Cucumber HTML Reporting (optional)
- Any screenshot taking library/dependency (optional)

## 3 Create Automated tests

[Content](#content)

Please create reusable parameterized Cucumber (BDD) steps in scenarios or using JUnit or TestNG (TDD) to test 3 user stories described below. Please try to utilize `configuration.properties` file of any of `.env` file approach to get some environment variable from.

Acceptance criteria:

1. **User should be able to add new person record to household on UI.**
   You can create your own Cucumber steps (BDD) or test scripts (TDD) to achieve goal. _As optional for extra points please save added personal demographic info to storage as POJO object or any other data format of your choice._

2. **Added person's record should be returned in API call.** Validate that added person's data returned in API call with correct values submitted on UI. Please refer to [API documentation](#api-documentation) below. _As optional for extra points please use [jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) to create and compare POJO objects or compare saved data in your storage using data format of your choice._

3. **Added person's record should be found in database.** please review database schema on DBeaver to understand table relationships. Using your JDBC validate that new record saved with correct data. _As optional for extra points please use [jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) to create and compare POJO objects or compare saved data in your storage using data format of your choice._

4. **As optional for extra points please** create automation scenarios updating, deleting records on UI
